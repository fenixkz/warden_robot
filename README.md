# Inspection Robot 
My solution to Assignment I of Experimental Robotics class of the University of Genoa (UniGe)
## Introduction
This repository simulates the robot in a indoor environment for surveillance purposes. The main idea was to use [SMACH](http://wiki.ros.org/smach) library to create a State Machine that can simulate the needed behavior. Furthermore, the current repository uses [ARMOR](https://github.com/EmaroLab/armor) library to create the ontology using [armor_py_api](https://github.com/EmaroLab/armor_py_api). 
The repository was implemented on Docker container with Ubuntu 20.04 with ROS Kinetic and Python 3.8

## Scenario 
The robot is simulated in the indoor environment which is shown in the figure below
