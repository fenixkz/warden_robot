# Inspection Robot 
My solution to Assignment I of Experimental Robotics class of the University of Genoa (UniGe)
## Introduction
This repository simulates the robot in a indoor environment for surveillance purposes. The main idea was to use [SMACH](http://wiki.ros.org/smach) library to create a State Machine that can simulate the needed behavior. Furthermore, the current repository uses [ARMOR](https://github.com/EmaroLab/armor) library and different scripts described in [arch_skeleton](https://github.com/buoncubi/arch_skeleton), it also creates an ontology and does some queries and manipulations to it, using [armor_py_api](https://github.com/EmaroLab/armor_py_api). 

The repository was implemented on Docker container with Ubuntu 20.04 with ROS Kinetic and Python 3.8.  
Further, the documentation for the project can be found [here](https://github.com/fenixkz)
## Scenario
The robot is used to inspect different locations in the indoor environment. The robotâ€™s objective is to visit the different locations and stay there for some times.

The surveillance pollicy is as folows:
 - When the robot's battery is not low, it should move to different locations 
 - The robot should stay mainly in the corridors
 - If a reachable room has not been visited for some times it should visit it.
 - If the robot's battery got low, it should go to the location containing the charging station and recharge the battery.

## Environment
The robot is simulated in the indoor environment which is shown in the figure below 
![env](https://github.com/fenixkz/warden_robot/blob/main/figures/exprorob.png)

The environment consists of locations and doors, specifically:
 - A room is a location with one door
 - A corridor is a location with more than two doors
 - If two locations share the same door, the robot can move between these locations

The skeleton of the environment has been created by __Luca Buoncomapgni__ [here](https://github.com/buoncubi/topological_map), which can be found in the _topological_map_ folder.
